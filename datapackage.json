This version focuses on datasets relevant to coal production and the US electricity sector (the mines themselves, their production and employment histories, the entities operating the mines, etc.). Subsequent versions will hopefully integrate additional resources published by MSHA.\n\nThis data was packaged for easy re-use by [Catalyst Cooperative](https://catalyst.coop) as part of the [Public Utility Data Liberation (PUDL)](https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl) project.
